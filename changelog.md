# mchv230vac1.5kw-33ch512mp508-pmsm-foc-pll-pfc-dualmotor v1.0.0
### Release Highlights
This is the first version of code for sensorless field oriented control of PMSM using PLL estimator, integrated with Power Factor Correction on MCHV-230VAC-1.5KW Development Board(EV78U65A) with dsPIC33CH512MP508 Dual MC DIM (EV62S33A). 
The firmware is set up for running Leadshine 400W 220VAC Servo Motor(EL5-M0400-1-24 : AC300025). The configuration for the second motor is provided via the XPRO connector on the MCHV-230VAC-1.5KW Development Board; however, the corresponding inverter board is not included, enabled, or tested as part of this demonstration.
This motor was tested under no load conditions. To achieve optimal performance under loaded conditions, the control parameters in the firmware may need additional tuning.
